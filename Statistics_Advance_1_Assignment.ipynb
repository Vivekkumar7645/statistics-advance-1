        "3. Normal Distribution as the Limit:\n",
        "  * The key insight of the CLT is that no matter how \"non-normal\" the original data is (it could be skewed, bimodal, or have other irregularities), the distribution of the sample mean will become increasingly normal as the sample size increases.\n",
        "  * If you keep increasing the sample size n, the sampling distribution of the mean will more closely resemble a standard normal distribution (i.e., a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1), provided the original data doesn't have extreme outliers or other issues like heavy-tailed distributions.\n",
        "4. Practical Use of the Normal Distribution:\n",

        "**Ans** - In statistics, point estimates and interval estimates are two ways to estimate population parameters based on sample data. Both are important tools in inferential statistics, allowing us to make conclusions about a population from a sample.\n",

        "1. **Point Estimate**\n",
        "\n",
        "A point estimate is a single value that serves as an estimate for an unknown population parameter. It's essentially a best guess or approximation for the parameter of interest based on the sample data.\n",

        "**Significance of Confidence Intervals**\n",
        "1. Improving Interpretation of Results: In scientific research and data analysis, results are rarely exact, and researchers must communicate not just a single estimate but also the degree of uncertainty associated with it. A confidence interval helps to express this uncertainty clearly.\n",
        "  * For instance, if a clinical trial estimates the mean difference in blood pressure between two treatment groups, reporting a confidence interval allows researchers to understand the range of possible true differences and make informed decisions about the effectiveness of the treatments.\n",
        "2. Assessing the Reliability of Estimates: Confidence intervals help assess the reliability of the results. If a confidence interval is narrow, it suggests that the estimate is precise and reliable. Conversely, a wide confidence interval may indicate that the estimate is less reliable, and further research or larger sample sizes may be needed to draw more reliable conclusions.\n",
        "3. Evaluating the Magnitude of Effect: In studies where an effect size or difference between groups is measured, confidence intervals allow for evaluation of the magnitude of the effect and its practical significance. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the difference in means between two groups can tell us whether the difference is practically significant and whether it crosses a threshold of interest.\n",
        "4. Interpreting Results with Uncertainty: Confidence intervals provide a more cautious interpretation of the data compared to relying solely on a point estimate. A point estimate might suggest that the mean of a population is exactly 50, but the confidence interval tells us that the true population mean could reasonably fall within that range.\n",
